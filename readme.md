- tkinter

## Files

The project contains the following Python scripts:

- `main.py`: The main script to run the processing pipeline.
- `introFunc.py`: Contains helper functions for file handling and data loading.
- `supportFuncPand.py`: Contains functions for data processing and cleaning.
- `calculateBasesCausas.py`: Contains the function `func_calculate_bases_causas` for specific calculations.

```sh
python main.py
```
This will start the processing pipeline which reads the SII files, performs necessary calculations, and writes the processed data to an Excel file.
